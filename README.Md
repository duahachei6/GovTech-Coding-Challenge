This program generates ID's for employees using the first three letters of their first name followed by three digits
Since only the first three letters are used, there bound to be multiple employees with the same three letters.
So we use the trailing digits to distinguish the IDs. The trailing digits starts with 005.
For example, if a new employee name Kara wants to generate an ID, the program will first search if there 
are any IDs starting with kar, if not it will produce kar005. But if it does find an ID with kar, it will add a 5 to 
trailing digits making it kar010.
